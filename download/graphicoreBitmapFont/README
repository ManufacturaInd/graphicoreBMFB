graphicore Bitmap Font

is a Bitmap Typeface that was early inspired by Underwares “Sauna bold italic swash”
and eventually went on it‘s own way. It‘s crisp on the screen at a size of 8px and
multiples thereof. However the intended use case lies rather in display sizes.
Using these fonts is a statement towards the core elements of perception of our
times — pixels. Resolution is finite. Anti-aliasing is a lie!

The typeface itself is defined in a custom format where the glyphs are stored in
text-files idiomatically as bitmaps. Like in the Ascii-Art above a dot stands for
“no pixel” and the Numbersign marks the opposite. This is what I believe a
bitmap font should be like — made out of bitmaps. The Character editing was done
in a simple text editor program.
